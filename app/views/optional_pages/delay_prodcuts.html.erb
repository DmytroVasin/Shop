  <strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><p>6.1 Our display of products on our website is an invitation to treat and not an offer to
      sell those goods to you.</p></li>
    <li><p>6.2 An offer is made when you place the order for your products. However we will not have
      made a contract with you unless and until we accept your offer. (see point 6.5 below)</p></li>
    <li><p>6.3 We take payment from your card, when we process your order and have checked your card
      details. Goods are subject to availability. If we are unable to supply the goods,

      (Order Acknowledgement). This is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from us.</p></li>
    <li><p>6.5 Unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it,
      order acceptance and the creation of the contract (Contract) between you and us will take
      place at the point the goods you have ordered are dispatched from our warehouse to be
      delivered to the address you have given us. It does not take place until
      that stage, even though we may have debited your card (see 6.3 above) or we have sent
      acknowledging e-mails (see 6.4 above).</p></li>
    <li><p>6.6 All orders that you place on this website will be subject to acceptance in accordance
      with clause 6.5 of these terms and conditions.</p></li>

      the products in accordance with our refunds policy (set out in paragraph 11 below).</p></li>
    <li><p>7.2 To cancel a Contract, you must inform us in writing and return the Product(s) to us
      immediately, in the same condition in which you received them, and at your own cost and risk.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>7.3 Orders cancelled by you within this seven-day cooling-off period will be refunded
      in full, including the cost of sending the item to you. However, you will be responsible for

      our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. If a
      Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our
